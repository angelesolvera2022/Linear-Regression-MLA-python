# Linear-Regression-MLA-python
In this project, I predicted life expectancy for different countries in 2030 using a linear regression model with data from 2000-2015. Steps included data exploration, feature engineering, preprocessing, model evaluation, and creating a function for future predictions. This approach ensured accurate and reliable results.
